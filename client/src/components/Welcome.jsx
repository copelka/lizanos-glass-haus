    Welcome  to Lizano's Glass Haus, a one-of-a-kind glass art studio in Metairie specializing in custom "New Orleans" designs. The love of the Crescent City is visible in works at the studio. Our art glass is very often framed in old cypress windows and transoms, restoring and bringing them back to life with colored art glass and fascinating designs. Our family-run business is proud to offer customers exquisite designs in stained glass panels. Lizano's Glass Haus also offers some non-traditional works in glass, ranging from contemporary fused glass pieces, mosaics, sandblasting and glass carving. Outdoor glass work is done here as well, combining glass and cement to create beautiful garden and patio stepping stones.

    Make sure to ask us about our new "Blue Roof", Katrina Art, we have created to assist those who had losses. We are pleased to share with the public the art of stained glass in all facets; traditional, contemporary, abstract, anything the client envisions. Our art work can be found in homes, restaurants, churches, chapels and schools around the New Orleans metropolitan area; even at the Audubon Zoo. Our clientele ranges from home owners to architects, interior designers to entomologists commissioning a larger than life spider web. We are creative individuals and thrive on our craftsmanship. Glass is a fascinating medium, which has energized our creative souls at Lizano's Glass Haus. Please stop by if in the area or visit our Gallery to see some of what we do.
